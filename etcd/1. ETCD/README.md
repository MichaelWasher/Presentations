# Starting a Single-Node ETCD instance

In Kubernetes, etcd serves as a distributed key-value store, essential for storing configuration data, cluster state, and metadata. It provides reliable and consistent data access, vital for cluster management and coordination.

The simplest form of running etcd is a Single-Node etcd instance, which involves setting up a standalone etcd server on a single machine. This configuration is suitable for development or testing environments and doesn't provide high availability or fault tolerance.


To run a single-node etcd cluster, follow these instructions:

1) Install the ETCD application
   Download and install etcd on your machine, ensuring it's in your system's PATH.

2) Configuration: 
   Create an etcd configuration file with settings like data directory, listening URLs, and cluster details.

3) Start etcd: 
   Launch the etcd server using the configuration file with the etcd command.

4) Verify Status: 
   Confirm that etcd is running correctly using etcdctl or by checking its status.
